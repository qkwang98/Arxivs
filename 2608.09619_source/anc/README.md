The object is the Schur polynomial at a full root-of-unity orbit together with one free reciprocal
pair,

```
Phi_t(lambda; z) = s_lambda( 1, zeta, ..., zeta^(t-1), z, 1/z ),    zeta = exp(2 pi i / t),
```

a polynomial in `N = t + 2` variables, and — for the zero locus — its several-pair generalization

```
Psi_r(lambda) = s_lambda( 1, -1, z_1, 1/z_1, ..., z_r, 1/z_r ),     N = 2r + 2.
```

The published rank-one case at `t = 2` is Part IV of the series,
[doi:10.5281/zenodo.21463000](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21463000), whose own scripts live in
[`schur-nonidentity-o4`](https://github.com/karlesmarin/schur-nonidentity-o4). This repository is the
general-`t` sequel and is kept separate so that each paper has one artifact.

## 🧪 Controls that are meant to fail

A test that cannot fail proves nothing, so three of these scripts print a deliberate negative:

- **`falsify.py`** applies the same identity to the coset alphabet and to a *free* (non-reciprocal)
  pair. It fails in 217 and 400 of 600 cases — the reciprocity hypothesis is doing work.
- **`sign_ayyer_idiom.py`** prints, before the real test, the same comparison with the two blocks in
  arbitrary order: **592 agree, 904 disagree**. `lambda11` and `sgn(a1+a2-b1-b2)` are each
  antisymmetric under exchanging the blocks, so their product is invariant while the candidate
  formula is not; without a rule fixing which block is `A` the right-hand side is not a function of
  `lambda` at all.
- **`sign_proof_check.py`** checks the three steps of the proof rather than its conclusion, so a
  disagreement can be localised: the parity count on random words, where it can fail; the resulting
  formula for `inv(w) - inv(b_S)`; and the arithmetic fact that closes it. Its own control repeats
  the middle step with the ordering hypothesis dropped, and it fails 904 of 1496 — the hypothesis
  enters the proof at exactly one point, and this is that point.
- **`concentric_locus.py`** claims that the concentric branch is empty at odd `t`, which a script
  can satisfy by finding nothing anywhere. So it prints the even-`t` count on the same range next to
  it: **43**. A zero beside a zero would prove nothing.
- **`selfcomp_law.sage`** runs an even-width control: self-complementary shapes of *even* width, none
  of which vanishes. The parity hypothesis is load-bearing rather than decorative.

## ⚠️ Two cautions worth reading before you believe a number

**`close_X_r1.sage` contains an exploratory sub-check that does not hold**, and it prints roughly
4180 mismatches out of 6655. That sub-claim ("the 4×4 determinant is the signed sum of single `S`'s")
appears nowhere in the paper, and the script now says so on the line above it. The result the paper
rests on is the case analysis printed afterwards, whose ten buckets sum to 14950 with 0 violations.

**`prove_W.sage` uses a different range per `r`** — `run(1,12)`, `run(2,10)`, `run(3,9)` — so its
counts of non-standard labels, 33 / 14 / 0, are **not comparable across `r`**. A non-standard label
needs `|nu| >= 2r+3`, so the usable slack above that threshold is 7 / 3 / 0: the zero at `r = 3` is
the sweep stopping at the threshold, not the obstruction disappearing. Reading a trend off those
three numbers is a mistake, and it is one this repository made before catching it.

## 🧾 Sums, stated

A few table entries are sums of printed per-`r` lines rather than a single printed total. They are:

```
9961 = 2157 + 4542 + 3262     shapes scanned
 318 =  242 +   55 +   21     vanishers
 372 =   76 +  144 +  152     associate witnesses
14950 = the ten parity buckets of close_X_r1
 184 =   94 +   90            criterion vs exact object
 236 =  139 +   97            type-D labels reduced (unstable_closed; NOT the 97+67
                              of fig_reduction, which counts label classes per panel)
  80 =   55 +   25            isolating witnesses
  21 =   18 +    3            residual labels, reduced exactly
```

## 📐 Conventions

`t` is the order of the root of unity and `z` is the free reciprocal variable. Much of the
surrounding literature uses `t` for the free variable; these scripts do not.

In `theorem_full.setup` the two distinguished residue classes are ordered **by column**, which is
what the proof of the main theorem needs. The short form of the sign instead needs them ordered **by
residue**. `lambda11` is antisymmetric under exchanging the two blocks, so it must be recomputed
after any reordering — reusing it is a silent sign error.

Determinants use Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting rather than `mpmath.det`, because the
singular case is the one that has to be scored rather than raised.
