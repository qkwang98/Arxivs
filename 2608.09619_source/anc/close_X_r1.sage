# (X) CLOSED AT r=1 -- and with it R6 proved in both directions at r=1.
#
# Setup. c = z + 1/z,  S_n := (z^n - z^-n)/(z - z^-1), so S_0=0, S_1=1, S_{n+1} = c S_n - S_{n-1},
# and deg_c S_n = n-1.  Phi_A = (x^2-1)(x^2-cx+1), so P is divisible by Phi_A iff
#     P(1) = 0, P(-1) = 0, and P = 0 mod (x^2 - cx + 1).
# Using x^n = S_n x - S_{n-1} mod (x^2-cx+1), and splitting P(1),P(-1) by parity, the four
# conditions on (v_j)_{j in beta} are
#     (1) sum_{beta_j even} v_j = 0      (3) sum_j v_j S_{beta_j}   = 0
#     (2) sum_{beta_j odd}  v_j = 0      (4) sum_j v_j S_{beta_j-1} = 0
# so admissibility is the vanishing of a 4x4 determinant over Q[c] whose first two rows are the
# complementary parity indicators.
#
# LEMMA (the collapse).   S_b S_{b'-1} - S_{b'} S_{b-1} = -S_{b-b'}.
# So Laplace on the parity rows gives  det = sum_{e in E, o in O} +-(-S_{d(e,o)})  where d(e,o) is
# the DIFFERENCE of the two beta's that were not removed. Since deg_c S_n = n-1, distinct S_n are
# linearly independent, so the sum vanishes only by exact pairing of equal d's with opposite signs.
#
# The case analysis is then finite and complete:
#   |E| in {0,4} : the parity rows are (1,1,1,1) and (0,0,0,0)  -> det = 0  [TYPE (a)]
#   |E| in {1,3} : only 3 terms, and their d's are the three pairwise differences of a 3-set,
#                  which are always distinct (a-c = (a-b)+(b-c)) -> no pairing -> det != 0
#   |E| = 2      : 4 terms; a perfect matching into equal-d pairs exists only for the parity
#                  pattern E = {beta_1,beta_4}, O = {beta_2,beta_3}, and then exactly when
#                  beta_1 + beta_4 = beta_2 + beta_3, i.e. beta SYMMETRIC  [TYPE (b)].
#                  For the patterns {beta_1,beta_2} and {beta_1,beta_3} the required second
#                  condition is beta_1 - beta_2 = beta_4 - beta_3 < 0, impossible.
#
# This script verifies the LEMMA and every step of the case analysis mechanically.
