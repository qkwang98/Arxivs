"""Does the t-core decide the vanishing? Written to answer N. Kumari, 2 Aug 2026.

Three questions, all decided by exhaustive enumeration rather than by argument:

  (Q1) At fixed N, does the residue profile (n_0,...,n_{t-1}) determine core_t(lambda)?
       If yes, then EVERY condition on the profile -- in particular "n_i = 0 for some i",
       which is branch (a) / Theorem 3.1(i) -- IS a condition on the t-core.
  (Q2) Which core does a degenerate profile give? (Answer: never the empty one.)
  (Q3) Does the core determine whether Psi_r(lambda) = 0?
       (Answer: no. The second branch -- d_3 = 0, i.e. self-complementary of odd width
       at t = 2 -- is invisible to the profile, hence to the core.)

Q3 is the point: core -> vanishing is not a function, so no core-based restatement of the
criterion can exist, however the first branch is dressed up.

Exact arithmetic throughout (Fraction); Schur values by the bialternant at three generic
rational points, so "vanishes" means "vanishes at all three".
