# Problem 10.6, the computable half: does Theorem 7.1 (the extra locus) have an analogue for the
# universal symplectic and orthogonal characters?
#
# THE QUESTION.  [AK25, Thm 5.3] says f_lambda(x, Y, zeta Y, ..., zeta^{t-1} Y) = f_lambda(x) iff
# lambda is a t-core, for f of type s, sp or o.  Theorem 7.1 of this paper says that at OUR
# specialization -- the free part being one reciprocal pair, and equality allowed up to SIGN -- the
# criterion acquires exactly one extra family, and only for t even.  Problem 10.6 asks whether sp
# and o behave the same way, and whether the extra family is again indexed by an order-two element.
#
# HOW IT IS TESTED.  Everything happens in Lambda, where adjoining letters is a specialization of
# power sums:
#
#     the full orbit mu_t   ->   p_k  gets  + t   when t | k,  + 0 otherwise
#     one reciprocal pair   ->   p_k  gets  + z^k + z^-k
#
# so the two sides of the criterion are
#
#     LHS = f_lambda  at  p_k = t*[t|k] + z^k + z^-k          (the orbit and the pair)
#     RHS = f_lambda  at  p_k = z^k + z^-k                    (the pair alone)
#
# and the locus is { lambda : LHS = +- RHS }.  For type s this is exactly the test behind Figure 4,
# which is the control: it must return the t-cores plus, at even t, the family of Theorem 7.1 and
# nothing else.
#
# TWO EVALUATION POINTS.  An equality of Laurent polynomials is tested at two unrelated rational z,
# and a lambda is admitted only if both agree; one point alone would let a coincidence through.

# THE RANGE IS PART OF THE QUESTION, and getting it wrong makes the test measure something else.
# The right-hand side f_lambda(free part alone) VANISHES once ell(lambda) exceeds the rank of the
# free part: s_lambda(z,zbar) = 0 for ell(lambda) >= 3, and sp_lambda(z) = 0 for ell(lambda) >= 2.
# Beyond that range "LHS = +- RHS" is not the independence criterion at all -- it degenerates into
# "LHS = 0", which is the zero locus and a different question. A first run of this script with three
# rows and a rank-one free part reported hundreds of "extras" that were nothing but vanishing shapes.
# So each type is run with a free part of rank at least ell(lambda), and never past it.
#
#     s   : free part (z, 1/z) is rank 2 for Schur      -> ell(lambda) <= 2
#     sp  : free part (z_1, ..., z_R) is rank R         -> ell(lambda) <= R
#     o   : same

# A CONFOUND, and the control for it.  A Schur alphabet of p reciprocal pairs is 2p variables and
# admits ell(lambda) <= 2p; a symplectic or orthogonal one of p pairs has rank p and admits only
# ell(lambda) <= p.  So comparing type s at p=1 with sp and o at p=2 compares two-letter free parts
# against four-letter ones, and any difference could be the SIZE rather than the TYPE.  Type s is
# therefore run at p=2 as well, on the same two-row range: if its extra family survives there, the
# difference is the type; if it does not, the extra family is a fact about the minimal alphabet.
